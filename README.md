# **KNeighbors Regressor (KNN) Model for Financial Predictions**

This repository contains an implementation of an KNeighbors Regressor (KNN) model, specifically designed for predicting the prices of financial instruments such as currencies, stocks, and cryptocurrencies. The KNeighbors Regressor (KNN) algorithm leverages gradient boosting techniques, enabling it to capture intricate patterns in price movements and handle various dataset characteristics effectively. This approach enhances the accuracy and robustness of price forecasts across various datasets.

This is the original code sample for the KNeighbors Regressor (KNN) model. Explore my GitHub repository for additional models and implementations that cater to different financial prediction needs.
